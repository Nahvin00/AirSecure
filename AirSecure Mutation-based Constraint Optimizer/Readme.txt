AirSecure: Mutation-based Constraint Optimizer using Genetic Algorithm
by Nahvin Muthusamy


Description:

Mutation-based Constraint Optimizer is part of AirSecure project which is intended to use drones to partrol around areas with high criminal activity to 
reduce the overall crime rate. This Mutation-based Constraint Optimizer has been developed to cater the project by finding the optimal route to avoid 
constraints along the travel around the areas of high criminal activity. Mutation-based Constraint Optimizer does by implementing Genetic Algorithm 
which mainly focuses on mutation of chromosomes. This will avoid  drones crashing into any contraints along the path thus adding safety.  


Notes:

 1. It is recommanded to use Microsoft Visual Studio to run the coding as it was used to develop it.
 2. Additional four (4) files were submitted together with the source code named TEST.cpp in the zip folder called Code.zip. The four (4) files (pbPlots.hpp, supportLib.hpp, pbPlots.cpp, supportLib.cpp) are under the package called pbplots which intendeds to generate a performance graph for each run.
 3. When using Visual Studio, please create a new project and drag the coding files into the project (.hpp files under header files and .cpp under source files).
 4. Upon successfully running the code, a png image named plot.png will be created in the source directory which contains the performance graph of the run (This will be automatically opened when the coding reaches max generation).
 5. Different problem space can be implemented by modifying the problem space.
 6. An additional (.exe) file has been provided to demonstrate the capability of the project which will run without any installation. However, to modify settings, (.cpp) file needs to be modified.
 7. If you encounter any problem with the coding or not being able to run the coding, please write an issue in GitHub.


Thank you for reading. Have a nice day.
