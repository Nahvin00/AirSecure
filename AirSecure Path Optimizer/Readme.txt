AirSecure: Path Optimizer using Hamiltonian Cycle
by Nahvin Muthusamy

Description:

Path Optimizer is part of AirSecure project which is intended to use drones to partrol around areas with high criminal activity to 
reduce the overall crime rate. This Path Optimizer has been developed to cater the project by finding the shortest patrol route around
the areas of high criminal activity. Path Optimer finds the shortest path by implementing Hamiltonian Cycle. This will reduce the fuel
wastage of the drones thus providing more air time to patrol around.  


Notes:

 1. It is recommanded to use Microsoft Visual Studio to run the coding as it was used to develop it.
 2. When using Visual Studio, please create a new project and drag the coding files into the project.
 3. Different problem space can be implemented by modifying variables 'POINTS' and 'graph' which are marked by arrows.
 4. If you encounter any problem with the coding or not being able to run the coding, please write an issue in GitHub.


Thank you for reading. Have a nice day.
